# 👋 Hi, I'm Todd Alexander

Software engineer with a systems mindset and a foundation in large-scale production and creative collaboration. From delivering nightly content to millions at Conan to architecting streaming interfaces for Paramount+, I’ve built experiences that scale—across platforms, teams, and audiences.

- 🔧 **Developer Experience Advocate** — CI pipeline refactorer, testing automation architect (Jenkins, Docker, Cypress, Selenium), and dev velocity evangelist.
- 🎯 **Systems Builder** — Backend and frontend architecture, scalable feature rollouts, and modular code that sticks.
